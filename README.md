# LearnSeaborn

---

Seaborn is an open source Python library built on matplotlib.
Seaborn works easily with the Pandas library which allows users to seemlessly create and analyze customized graphs off of data that they can manipulate using Pandas. 

This github repository was created to store and allow others to view my notes and examples that I created while learning how to use Seaborn.
